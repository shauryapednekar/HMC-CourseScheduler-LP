In this course, we will consider several disciplines, such as art history, psychology, and philosophy, and their intersection with Africana Studies. We will discuss how these disciplines approach Africana Studies and how Africana Studies scholars can employ disciplinary lenses. In the process of producing a research paper this semester, you will explore and select the methods for which you will conduct your research.",

This course will be a general introduction to Africana Philosophy. We will unveil not only that philosophy is more than the western world and has points of origin in other places, such as Africa, but we will also discover how Africana philosophy serves as a challenge to the integrity of integral concepts and themes in modern western philosophy; for example, the subject, freedom, the human, and even ontology. We will achieve these insights through a survey of thinkers, writers, and people who address themes such as traditional africana thought, black existentialism, black feminism, post colonialism, whiteness, double consciousness, and afro-pessimism.",

The course then examines both the history of the crisis and the uses of historical representations to prop up the current political and social order of Israel and Palestine. In contrast with most received narratives, we find making of the crisis primarily in the shaping of ethnic conflict and ehtno-national state-making by partition under British colonial rule -- not in timeless enmities. The course is also concerned to understand why the status quo of the present is at once so violently oppressive for Palestinians and eyt something many jewis Israelis and their state accept. We also look at the crucial role of the US in maintaining, funding, and arming the status quo -- and how that may be changing. In the final section of the course we identify plausible futures for Palestine-Israel, and consider how a globally dispersed social justice movement can support the Palestinian struggle for equality and freedom -- and thereby foster a positive or just peace for all persons in Paletine and Israel.",

The subfield has developed its own extensive claims to a body of method and theory for dealing with the material remains of past human societies. ANTH 101 is designed to familiarize the student with several distinct, but inter-related aspects of archaeological method and theory. Archaeology has developed its own history in relation to anthropology and needs to be contextualized within this background. The field has also developed its own distinct methods based on reconnaissance, excavation, and analysis. All archaeology is interpretive and reliant upon the methods utilized to collect data as well as upon the theoretical backgrounds, assumptions, and analyses that are applied. Archaeologists must also be concerned with a host of ethical questions that are of concern to field research in the present. This course hopes to provide a background to understanding the uses of archaeological theory by specifically emphasizing the ways in which material culture can be utilized to make interpretations concerning both past and present behavior.

This course starts by examining the energy regime of mobile-foraging, sedentary-farming, and industrial models of livelihood, as these modes of livelihood are found distributed across the earth and through human time, starting some 100,000 years ago. The second section of the course looks at the perils of fossil fuels and nuclear energy, which have been the bases of humanity's startling new relationship to energy and energy consumption beginning in the early 1800s; it also asks whether shifting from these energy sources to energy sources that are sustainable and humane will require shifting to a non-growth (i.e., a non-capitalist) economy. And too, this section of the course challenges students to investigate how each College in the consortium is a \"complicit institution\" in the current inhumane energy regime. For the final section of the course, students must carefully plan and initiate an activist intervention that addresses and redresses the perils of fossil fuels and/or nuclear energy. Students who choose interventions that raise legal issues will be required to show they understand and have prepared for any such consequences; only non-violent interventions will be approved.",

        "courseDescription": "This course provides an intensive introduction to selected theories, methods, and themes in linguistic anthropology, one of the discipline's four subfields. The primary aim of the course is to familiarize students with the linguistic anthropological approach to language, according to which language is a social tool with significance for sociopolitical processes, on the one hand, and basic research methods in linguistic anthropology, on the other. The course has two interwoven parts. The first is the sequence of readings, which will be analyzed in particular for the evidence and methods on which they draw. These readings trace the development of linguistic anthropology chronologically, beginning with the branching of linguistics into the fields of theoretical linguistics and linguistic anthropology, then examining early linguistic anthropologists' inquiries into linguistic relativism and whether language shapes thought, before turning finally to contemporary semiotic approaches to language, illustrated through selected ethnographic examples. The second part of the course is a field practicum in which students will observe language in the social setting of their choice, produce field notes, and draft written analyses guided by questions that we will consider at length. Via their fieldwork students will become adept at using a range of methods for collecting data and analyzing how people use language, including participant observation, interviews, field notes, audio recordings, and discourse analytic transcriptions. The course also has a writing-intensive overlay; accordingly, throughout the semester students will write up a series of shorter ethnographic analyses that they will then revise and collate into an original research paper.",

In this hands-on studio class students will deconstruct, reconfigure, and critically analyze the methods of visual communication. An emphasis will be placed on the ability to use design to create forms which persuade, explain, make a claim, and invite the reader into a dialogue. Prerequisites: ART 021 PO or equivalent.

Other topics will include the historical production of the undocumented population in the U.S., demographic trends, the educational, work, and family lives of immigrant youth, and the shifting policy terrain including the impact of DACA and its culmination. Students will have the opportunity to engage in a collaborative project to develop deeper knowledge about a single issue related to undocumented immigration and/or immigrant youth. This collaborative project may include qualitative research and/or a community-engaged learning project with the aim of helping students engage with the principles of social justice and collaborative leadership through critical reflection within the classroom.

The coordinates of time and space will be the parameters in this study of the human imagination. Careful attention will be paid to two major intercultural and international issues, slavery, beginning in the ancient world, and the position of women, sometimes amounting to slavery, and, again, tracing back to the ancient world.",

Consult Schedule of Classes for topic to be offered in a specific term. May be repeated for credit with different topics. Permission of instructor required. Full credit. Topic for Spring ’20 – Hip-Hop/House Dance: This course will provide students with the opportunity to study Hip-Hop and House dance in a more advanced and academically rigorous context than currently exists in Claremont. Geared to dancers at the Intermediate level and higher, the course will include studyof historical, cultural, and aesthetic issues that underpin the movement practice. Hip-Hop has been an important force in minority communities where it has served as a medium for self-realization and social change. Hip-hop dance is now viewed in some settings as more essential to a dancer’s training thanmodern dance. Our students participate in a number of recreational hip-hop crews and have taken advantage of beginning level hip-hop classes offered through Pomona Dance and Physical Education. They have expressed strong desire to study the style at a more advanced level and with the same academic rigor that our department brings to other dance styles. The upcoming Humanities Institute – Hip-Hop Summit is just one piece of evidence supporting the relevance of Hip-Hop/House as a Selected Topic course.",

Though the chronological borders of that period shift from region to region (i.e. Southern to Northern Europe), it is generally a given that the period of time it designates is now closed. But what if the Renaissance is best conceived, not as a historical period, but as a historical project? What if the task of the reader is to understand the Renaissance as what Hans-George Gadamer called an \"unfinished event?\" The Renaissance so conceived is an idea that we might revive, revise, or redirect. The scholarly mode that it solicits is participation. This course will harness the core insights and innovations of the English Renaissance in order to imagine alternatives to modernity, the present moment, and the imminent future. Topics may include: human, nonhuman, and quasi-human; utopia, dystopia, and worldmaking; the abundance of language; metamorphosis and transformation. Written work will draw largely on exercises of the Elizabethan schoolroom, including: commonplace books; imitations, emulations, and adaptations; exercises in impersonation; and two essays. We will focus on works by Renaissance poets including Francesco Petrarch, Edmund Spenser, and William Shakespeare but we will also reach backward to poets like Ovid, and forward to writers including Oscar Wilde, Franz Kafka, and Jorge Luis Borges.",

We will explore texts that speculate on transnational futures in relation to imperial pasts, on ecological disasters both global and local, on artificial intelligence and the \"post-racial\" futures, and more, paying particular attention to questions of racial information and the specific material histories of Asian/Americans.

The first semester focuses on the connections and distinctions between continuous-time and discrete-time signals and systems and their representation in the time and frequency domains. Topics include impulse response, convolution, continuous and discrete Fourier series and transforms, and frequency response. Current applications, including filtering, modulation and sampling, are presented, and simulation techniques based on both time and frequency domain representations are introduced. In the second semester additional analysis and design tools based on the Laplace- and z-transforms are developed, and the state space formulation of continuous and discrete-time systems is presented. Concepts covered during both semesters are applied in a comprehensive treatment of feedback control systems including performance criteria, stability, observability, controllability, compensation and pole placement.

Through popular and documentary film, literature, journalism, music, and the visual arts, we will look at multiple facets of urban culture in Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, Bogotá, and La Habana. We will explore the histories of these cities and the various experiences of their inhabitants, focusing on their intersection with topics such as modernity, urban planning, development, racial, gender and social inequities, resistance, historical memory, environmental justice, and counter-cultural movements. Through these explorations, we will learn to read, watch, and travel with a more critical eye and a more comprehensive understanding.",

This course introduces case studies that help to unpack issues of legitimacy and public space. Debates around graffiti or street art (\"but is it art?\" or \"is it graffiti if...?\") tend to be instrumental rather than opening a space for critical reflection. Looking at graffiti through time, we unpack the questions that people ask and the constructs that they are making, and to see what we can learn about connections between expressive culture and the built environment/ Our class takes an ethnographic approach to the study of discourses around street art and graffiti -- including those from within the academy as well as from practitioners.",

This course will explore the sources and origins of such divisions. For instance, do activists on the left and right really exist in two distinct cultures? What are the philosophical assumptions and beliefs that hold their various political opinions together? What is their view of the human person and how does it shape the way they see the world? Do they each offer equally rational ways of comprehending the world? We will also investigate how deeply our nation is divided. Is it the case, for instance, that only a handful of radicals wage these wars while most Americans are actually quite moderate? Are our political divisions really rooted in separate cultures? In addition, we will ask whether the culture wars have been good or bad for American democracy. For example, have the culture wars prevented a descent into mass apathy or coarsened public life?",

Highlighting decolonial and indigenous thought in particular, course assignments examine planetary futures that reflect on how histories of imperial conquest, settler colonialism, and global capitalism have contributed to anthropogenic climate change. Another goal of the class is to question how contemporary approaches to environmentalism might have arisen out of already limited epistemological frameworks and legal histories. As part of our investigation into the asymmetrical distribution of toxins and environmental fallout across different populations, students will not only grapple with biopolitical theory but also look to a range of cultural texts - from science fiction films to contemporary fiction to graphic art - to consider alternative political assemblages and strategies for survival that arise from gender and ethnic studies frameworks.

In addition, we will explore the political implications of how the body is theorized. Rather than perpetuating a universalist understanding of the body as ahistorical or demanding an over-determined particularity around the body that neglects forms of relationality, we will seek to balance questions of bodily matter and experience with gestures towards relations to another. We will read scholars such as Hortense Spillers, Saba Mahmood, Michel Foucault, Susan Stryker, Anne Fausto-Sterling, Jean-Luc Nancy, Mel Chen, Bryan Turner and Gilles Deleuze.

The course then examines both the history of the crisis and the uses of historical representations to prop up the current political and social order of Israel and Palestine. In contrast with most received narratives, we find making of the crisis primarily in the shaping of ethnic conflict and ehtno-national state-making by partition under British colonial rule -- not in timeless enmities. The course is also concerned to understand why the status quo of the present is at once so violently oppressive for Palestinians and eyt something many jewis Israelis and their state accept. We also look at the crucial role of the US in maintaining, funding, and arming the status quo -- and how that may be changing. In the final section of the course we identify plausible futures for Palestine-Israel, and consider how a globally dispersed social justice movement can support the Palestinian struggle for equality and freedom -- and thereby foster a positive or just peace for all persons in Paletine and Israel.",

This course starts by examining the energy regime of mobile-foraging, sedentary-farming, and industrial models of livelihood, as these modes of livelihood are found distributed across the earth and through human time, starting some 100,000 years ago. The second section of the course looks at the perils of fossil fuels and nuclear energy, which have been the bases of humanity's startling new relationship to energy and energy consumption beginning in the early 1800s; it also asks whether shifting from these energy sources to energy sources that are sustainable and humane will require shifting to a non-growth (i.e., a non-capitalist) economy. And too, this section of the course challenges students to investigate how each College in the consortium is a \"complicit institution\" in the current inhumane energy regime. For the final section of the course, students must carefully plan and initiate an activist intervention that addresses and redresses the perils of fossil fuels and/or nuclear energy. Students who choose interventions that raise legal issues will be required to show they understand and have prepared for any such consequences; only non-violent interventions will be approved.",

The workers’ own voices and analyses are foregrounded. Eduardo Galeano’s famous interpretive essay Open Veins of Latin America serves as a narrative thread for the course. Several of the case studies examine relations between workers in Latin America or Caribbean countries and their U.S. employers, as well as Black, Latinx workers in the United States. In other words, this course offers an economic history through the eyes of people who have labored in subhuman conditions.",

        "courseDescription": "This upper-level research seminar explores the Enlightenment and 18th-century revolutions by focusing on London and Paris as epicenters of culture, commerce, and politics. How did urban institutions, print culture, an emerging consumer marketplace, and a booming population contribute to new social relations and tensions? How did both cities' networks and urban landscape facilitate revolution? Using historical texts, maps, economic and demographic data, art, architecture, literature, and the contemporary press, we will research how urban life in London and Paris shaped the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the American Revolution, the Enlightenment and French Revolution, and how inhabitants experienced these transformations.",

Registration requires application. For information on applying, see http://www.scrippscollege.edu/hi/junior-fellows-program. May apply to repeat once for credit. Offered spring.SPRING 2019:We will read and discuss work recommended by the speakers on the program as well as some background material. Students will be expected to attend all Humanities Institute events. The theme for Spring 2019 is Ignorance in the Age of Information. Information is more accessible to more people than ever. Yet, one of the central concerns in the public consciousness today is that we seem especially susceptible to deceit and manipulation via our sources of information, including both the internet in its various forms and more traditional news media. This year, the Humanities Institute will focus on this concern, regarding both content (like \"fake news\" and other misinformation), and form (like the \"echo chamber\" or \"filter bubble\" of social media news feeds).",

This course does not focus on syntactic theory, but instead introduces students to the wide range of grammatical structures that are possible in human language. The course includes overview readings and discussions of broadly attested morphosyntactic patterns. In addition, students will research an individual (unfamiliar) language over the course of a semester (based on existing research on the language) and will present the structures of their chosen language back to the class on a regular basis in both written and oral form. In this way the class serves to introduce students to the range of morphosyntactic constructions in a broad range of the world's languages. This course satisfies the 'Syntax' requirement of the Linguistics major, but it does not serve as a prerequisite for LGCS 183 Topics in Generative Syntax. Letter grade only.

Thus, our goal for the semester is to begin the process of unveiling the American prison. To advance this process, we'll think about questions such as, Who benefits from the prison? Who is hurt by the prison? What is the history of the prison? What is the future of the prison? In the effort to answer these kinds of questions, we'll begin by reading, writing and talking about the history, sociology, and politics of the prison. Once we develop a conceptual vocabulary that will help us to discuss American penal practices, we will engage with a series of important cultural texts produced about the prison and from within the prison. We'll read poems, novels and memoirs, watch films, and listen to music, all in the effort to better understand the functions and consequences of the American prison. Ultimately, our study will give us the capacity to rigorously and thoughtfully consider our own relations to the prison, and to act upon our learning.",

The main focus will be on American cinema and media, though we will look at some examples of horror from other countries for comparison. We will also look at some more historical material - Dracula and Frankenstein, for example - but the bulk of the course will be devoted to contemporary horror (from the 1990s to the present), including films like NEAR DARK, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, IT FOLLOWS, GET OUT, and MIDSOMMAR. Work for the course includes four polished essays.",

In other words, we’re fascinated by monsters, those others that stand at the margins of human, civilized society, threatening us by their very existence. Are monsters only very scary things, or do they have a social and cultural function? In this course we will take up this and other questions as we investigate the nature of the monstrous. Moreover, we will explore the libidinal charge that the recognition of the monstrous or unnatural being evokes. Thus, we will examine both the physical and psychological permutations of monstrosity. In this course, we will consider monsters in their non-human, alien, and technological forms as well as some truly terrifying human monsters.",

In class, we'll look beyond basic elements of craft and address issues of concern for the experienced writer. How do we avoid cliche? Create narrative drive? Take risks with form, language, and subject matter? Written exercises will focus on these issues while challenging students to push their writing in unexpected directions.

The course starts out with classic film theory and concludes with a consideration of the impact of digitization. Along the way we will learn a number of terms, theoretical concepts and methodological approaches to critically evaluate and analyze fictional films, including formalism, realism, genre, ideology, semiotics, structuralism, psychoanalysis and postmodernism. We will consider the question of how forms of analog film fare in the digital era and what is meant by the pronouncement of the \"death of film.\" Letter grade only.

Focus, aperture, and shutter may be automated alone or in concert. These fixes are just the beginning of the ways that computation will change photography. Soon cameras will make images without optics, manipulate time to sharpen the image, even see around corners to recover faces. We will study the impacts that computational photography will make on the arts, consider the consequences of new propaganda, and propose tactics to deal with these disruptions. Part 2 builds on our study of cameras and representation and moves into computer vision, image processing, digital cameras, image segmentation, high-dynamic-range imaging, texture analysis and synthesis, object detection, and projector-camera systems.

This course examines some of the key factors that have contributed to the horror genres capacity to maintain its continued viability in popular culture across a wide range of media including graphic novels, video art, and interactive gaming. Beginning with the modern period of the American horror film and then expanding beyond its physical and ideological borders, this course is designed to encourage students to challenge the ideas that have become associated with the term \"horror,\" and to consider whether some other term or terms may be better suited to describe the types of feelings horror films and its related forms of media actually inspire. We will consider some of the following questions: What is horror? Do horror genre films truly inspire horror or are we, as participants, moved by some other affect or response? Is it possible to locate cinematic representations of horror and its experience outside of the horror genre? Prerequisites: MS 049 PO, or MS 050 PO, or MS 051 PO or equivalent. Letter grade only.",

Students will demonstrate learning through classroom participation, short point papers, an in-class presentation and two longer analytical papers. This course is NOT about learning names, dates, and places. Rather, this course is designed to interest students in the study of American military history from the Civil War period to the present. Critical thinking about \"the whys\" things happened is the focus.

The innovative method of exercise demands intense focus on certain muscle groups while all the time engaging the abdominals. This type of activity increases strength and flexibility around the spinal column as well as other major muscle groups.

This is achieved by improving one’s aerobic fitness, coordination, strength, flexibility, and reflexes. Second, develop an appreciation for the Budo (Martial Art) culture, etiquette and philosophy. Third, the training in karate is used as a vehicle to inspire personal excellence and strives to cultivate one’s character by valuing such traits as courtesy, respect and humility. The student who perseveres will develop courage, self-control, and self-discipline. If these three objectives are kept in view Karate-Do becomes a healthy learning process and an excellent means of prolonging ones life by keeping physically fit. P/NC only.

As a historical evolution of Greek Philosophy, Islamic philosophy synthesizes both the Aristotelian and the Post-Plotinian traditions in an independent way.

We will discuss topics including the divine attribute and essence, the origin and the nature of the universe, the relation between philosophy and religion, the existence and faculties of the soul, the idea of the philosopher king, Skepticism, what is Islam, the concept of humanity in Islam, mysticism, the problem of good and evil, the end of postcolonialism, women and the Quran. Through selective readings of philosophical texts, we will introduce the main figures, including al-Farabi, Avicenna, al-Ghazali, Averreos, al-Razi, Ibn Tufayl, Arkoun, Shari’ati, Nasr Abu Zayd, Amina Wadud, and ‘Abd al-Raziq, Hamid Dabashi.",

Along the way, humans tap into this energy supply using tools such as solar collectors, wind turbines, and engines that burn fossil fuels. How humans harvest and use energy matters because the byproducts of the 500 EJ (5×10^20 J) of energy that humans use globally each year impacts the atmosphere and the ocean and thereby affects our climate. The HMC Core curriculum provides a springboard for understanding the science that governs how our climate behaves. This course will use what you've learned in the core to study the most important levers that drive our climate and to educate you about carbon-free energy resources. Throughout the course we will explore how human activity currently affects our climate and how we might provide energy to meet our future needs while reducing our impact on the climate.",

Law is often understood to derive its legitimacy from its opposition to violence. And yet, paradoxically, the enforcement of law is inseparably bound to acts of state violence, both threatened and enacted. What role has law played in organized movements to suppress race-based violence? How have appeals to law supplied tools of recourse, resistance, political struggle, and freedom? Alternatively, when and how might law create, sustain, or institutionalize violence against people of color? What roles do gender and sexuality play in negotiating the boundaries of violence and law? Drawing principally from African American political thought, this course considers the relationship between violence and law in three historical contexts: slavery and abolition, segregation and civil rights, and the rise of mass incarceration.",

We provide a curricular structure for the exchange, which includes exchange stages, platforms and activities stressing specific vocabulary and grammar. There is room for students from both countries to share topics and materials according to their own needs and interests. The ultimate goal of the community is to improve oral proficiency in the target languages through a meaningful experience of exchange.

Students may register more than once in Directed Research. A maximum of 1 credit may accumulate to apply toward graduation (not major) requirements.

Apocalyptic symbolism has been implicated in the rise and renewal of major religious traditions, revolutions (of both “secular” and “religious” varieties), and major historical events. The events of the apocalypse have also provided material for some of the most creative expressions of artistic, literary, and cultural phenomena throughout human history. This course explores some of the ways in which the apocalyptic is expressed across Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and beyond while also addressing key theoretical concerns in apocalyptic studies.",

Our outlook will be primarily driven by critical-theoretical methods for the study of religion, including feminism, queer theory, post-/decolonial critique, disability studies, and discourse analysis and will have one eye firmly fixed on how Jesus and Paul as figures and/or writers continue to influence society and sexuality today.",

Among others, it continues a partnership with Vancouver Island University and its Aboriginal Mentorship Program. The course will focus on two interrelated areas of theory and praxis. The first is college access and success for American Indian / First Nation students. Attention will be given to the Pitzer Native Summer Program, the VIU Aboriginal Mentorship program, and efforts to build educational pathways for Southern California Indian students. Secondly, the course will focus on decolonizing processes that continue to prepare the Pitzer, 5C and Claremont area communities to be critically informed and interculturally competent and thus more able to support Indigenous Nations, communities and students. This will involve work on a) the Blanket Exercise, a popular education tool for education about settler colonialism and Indigenous resilience; and b) Personal Portfolio project through which students will research their own personal, family and cultural relationships to process of nationalism,, settlement, displacement, and intergroup relations regarding their own home town or territory. Thus the course will involve readings, praxis, and discussion. Class will meet every week for 2 hours; times to be determined. The course will require involvement in college access / prep activities throughout the spring, as well as activities as part of the Blanket Exercise described above. Together, these out-of-weekly class times will be a significant amount equal to or greater than 50 additional minutes every week.",

As such, this class not only provides a reflective lens but also provides students with the opportunity to engage challenging and diverse readings as well as participate in active, stimulating and fun class discussions. Over the semester, students will have the opportunity to reflect on what you have learned in your sociology courses in three distinct ways: a) becoming an expert in discussing a particular social institution - either one you engaged or didn't engage at Pitzer; b) create and submit blog posts using media and quotes to our class Tumblr page (site under construction) - these posts will serve as a way of showing that you can teach sociology to the general masses and c) applying your sociological expertise to a real-world situation and make policy recommendations. In addition, our class meets once a week in which we will discuss poignant readings related to the study of social structure that not only focus on the lives of individuals within social groups but also more critically examines the social relationships that foster social inequity and/or foster social change.",

For scene work, we will take an extended critical look at up to four plays which examine the American dream through two different cultural lenses: August Wilson's Fences in relation to Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman and Lorraine Hansberry's A Raisin in the Sun in contrast to Clybourne Park by Bruce Norris.

May be repeated for credit. Offered one semester per year. SP19: Our focus will be on investigative fiction: a hybrid form of writing that is at once highly personal and deeply researched. This approach transcends genre, and can be exercised in writing that is otherwise described as the non-fiction, or documentary novel, biography, autobiography or autofiction. We will be writing two original texts during the semester, working under the influence of selected texts by writers such as Janet Flanner, George Orwell, Carlos Monsivais, Colette, Frank Sargeson and Chester Himes.",
