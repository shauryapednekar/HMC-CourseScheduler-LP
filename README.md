# HMC Course Scheduler

Steps:

1. Add your data to the .py files in the "user" directory (5 python files with instructions within).
2. In main.py:
   1. Update the dat_filename variable (line 22) to desired filename.
   2. In the main() function's arguments, let selected=True if you only want to include the courses from preferences.py or
      False if you want to include all possible courses.
   3. Update the other arguments to main() if necessary.
3. Run main.py
4. Run ampl exec.run (full filepath for exec.run).

Voila! You now have the optimal course schedule based on your preferences and requirements.
